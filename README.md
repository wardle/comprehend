# comprehend : natural language processing for SNOMED CT

This is a thin wrapper bringing together the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Comprehend Medical 
service with a SNOMED terminology server, [hermes](https://github.com/wardle/hermes).

At the moment, it is simply a library that is used by [pc4](https://github.com/wardle/pc4) but
it would be straightforward to build this as an independent microservice, even
if only for demonstration purposes initially!
